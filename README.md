PLEASE NOTICE

Photoshop CC 2015 introduced features that INK is not supporting yet:

1 - Ink does not support artboards. If you need to document your mockups with Ink, please use a document that does not contain artboards. To create a document without artboards, you can select File -> New -> Document Type: “Custom” from the Photoshop Menu.

2 - Ink does not support multiple fx of the same type (for example, two drop shadows fx on the same layer).

Since Extension Manager is not supporting CC 2015 products anymore, you will have to manually install Ink for Photoshop CC 2015.
